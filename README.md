# Personal Site
At present a work in progress -- but, the goal is to cook something up nicely for my portfolio/domain that I have hosted for no particular reason.

This is a fully vibe-coded web-site, made and deployed in around a total 3 hours of work.


## TODO:
- Make certain buttons point to home.
- Keep table of contents in reading mode too.
