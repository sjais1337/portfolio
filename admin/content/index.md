This is the personal site of **Shivansh Jaiswal**, presently a sophomore in the department of Economic Sciences at IIT Kanpur. I like to learn and write about various domains, and at present have found my niche in systems level programming. I am experienced in developing web applications, and implementing machine learning models. As of recent, I've also taken to cryptology, thanks to a course (CS641) I'm taking this semester.

The intent of this site is to publish all my writings, whether academic, philosphical, expository or completely random. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sjais1337), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjais1337/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sjais1337/). 

This site is written (read, vibecoded) primarily in plain HTML, CSS, JS and uses PHP for functionality. It doesn't require opening any FTP/SSH connection to publish articles and manages directories entirely on its own. The articles are stored in `.md` files, and are rendered using a built-in `.md` file parser. The goal with using `.md` files with a parser was to achieve simplicity, since most my writings are written in that format only.

There are a lot of personalization options present in the site, which you are free to choose to enhance your reading experience. Click on the **"THEMES"** menu item in the top navbar to explore your options. You can find the source code of this site in [my repository](https://github.com/sjais1337/portfolio).
