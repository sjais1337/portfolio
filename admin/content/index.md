You have connected to **System J** — a terminal-based interface for navigating thoughts, projects, and documentation.

The modern web obscures its machinery beneath layers of abstraction. We have traded raw information density for "user experience." This space is an explicit rejection of that paradigm.

## Navigation

Use the **file browser** on the left to explore:

- **Blog** — Technical writings and guides
- **Pages** — System documentation and meta-content
- **Root files** — Resume and other standalone documents

All content is stored as plain Markdown. No JavaScript frameworks. No build tools. Just text.

## Sharing

Every page has a unique URL. Copy the address bar to share a direct link to any article.
