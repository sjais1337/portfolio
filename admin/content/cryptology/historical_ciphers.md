# Historical Ciphers

**Index of Coincidence**: The probability that two characters selected at random from a text are the same. Let us say that the total number of characters is $N$ and $k$ different characters are available. Starting from an evenly distributed system with $p$ characters of each kind, we will have $p = N/k$ but like, suppose the characters with increased frequency are there and then there are characters with decreased frequency. Suppose increased frequency are $k_{i_1}, k_{i_2}, .., k_{i_l}$ and decreased frequency are $k_{j_1}, k_{j_2}, .., k_{j_m}$ where $m+l=k$. Then, the corresponding difference will look like, $$ \left(\sum_{r=1}^{m} \frac{(p+I_{i_r})^2}{N^2}\right) + \left(\sum_{r=1}^{l} \frac{(p-D_{i_r})^2}{N^2}\right) - k\frac{p^2}{N^2}$$ Now, expanding it $$\left(\sum_{r=1}^{m} \frac{I^2_{r_1}+2pI_{r_1}}{N^2}\right) + \left(\sum_{r=1}^{l} \frac{D^2_{r_1}-2pD_{r_1}}{N^2}\right)$$But, it’s known that $\sum_{r=1}^{m} I_{i_r} = \sum_{r=1}^{l} D_{i_r}$ since increase in frequency must be equal to decrease in frequency. Thus, overall we are just left with the squared terms which are always positive. Thus, it’s as the distribution becomes more uneven, and there’s more inequality then the value of index of coincidence increases.
